  <h2>Description:</h2>
  <p>This is an easy, family-favorite recipe for thinly sliced chicken breasts. It's quick enough to throw together after a long day at work. Serve it over white rice or pasta with green beans or a salad.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>Salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
    <li>1 pound thin-sliced chicken breast cutlets</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
    <li>½ cup butter</li>
    <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
    <li>¼ cup lemon juice</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>4 sprigs fresh parsley</li>
    <li>1 medium lemon, cut into wedges</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Whisk 2 cups flour, salt, and pepper together in a shallow bowl. Whisk eggs in another shallow bowl.</li>
    <li>Dredge chicken in flour; shake off excess. Dip into beaten egg. Lift up so excess egg drips back into the bowl.</li>
    <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Pan-fry chicken until golden brown, 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 minutes per side; transfer to a plate.</li>
    <li>Melt butter in the same skillet over medium-low heat. Whisk in 2 tablespoons flour and stir until the mixture becomes paste-like and light golden brown, about 5 minutes. Gradually whisk chicken broth and lemon juice into flour mixture, and bring to a simmer. Cook and stir until thick and smooth, about 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Return chicken to the skillet. Continue simmering until chicken is no longer pink in the center, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
    <li>Garnish with parsley and serve with lemon wedges.</li>
  </ol>
